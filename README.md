# glds_microarrays.R

## Description

This executable R script is the main function for processing GeneLab microarray datasets. It may be run with local data if runsheet and raw data files are supplied or called by glds_microarrays.sh which will pull data from the GeneLab repository API. It currently supports all Affymetrix platforms and Agilent one and two channel platforms. Support for Illumina Beadchip, Nimblegen one and two channel platforms as well as generic two channel platforms is in development.

```

## API Execution

From the command line run:
```bash
sh glds_microarrays.sh <GLDS-XXX>

### Input

Basic Options | Type | Description
------------- | ---- | -----------
--glds | character | Accession ID of the GLDS study to be processed
--reports | flag | If this flag is given, the script will generate raw and normalized quality assessment reports as HTML files
--runsheet | path | Path to GeneLab generated run_sheet.csv metadata file for local processing
--probe | path | Path to custom probe annotation file, primarily for two-channel datasets. If not supplied, the script will attempt to pull probe annotations from raw data files or from Bioconductor source databases
--out | path | Optional path to desired output directory. If not supplied, output will be copied to Processed_Data in the execution directory

Additional options are available for customized runs from local data utilizing ISAtab formatted metadata
Additional Options | Type | Description
------------------ | ---- | -----------
--files | path | Shell path to raw data file set. Accepts wildcards for multiple entries
--isa | path | Path to ISA.zip formatted metadata file
--species | character | Specify organism (e.g. "Arabidopsis thaliana")
--platform | character | Specify microarray platform (e.g. "Affymetrix")
--annotation | path | Path to organism gene level annotation file
--dir | path | Path to GeneLab curated directory structure top for a GLDS study

### Output

The script generates an output directory with the following structure:

## Platform Processing Functions

### affymetrix.R

This function takes the glds_microarray.R options object as input and generates output files customized to the Affymetrix platform. 
Preprocessing is performed with the Oligo package. RMA background correction and Quantiles normalization are performed to generate normalized expression values. For ST class arrays, core gene level estimation is performed. DGE analysis is performed with the Limma package. Control probes and unannotated probes are filtered. Multiple probes mapping to a gene identifier are aggregated by maximum interquartile range. Normalized expression values are fit to a linear model with empirical Bayes estimation of priors. Group contrast log fold change, t-test p-values, and Benjamini Hochberg adjusted p-values with FDR of 0.05 are calculated.

### agilent_one_channel.R

This function takes the glds_microarray.R options object as input and generates output files customized to the Affymetrix platform.
